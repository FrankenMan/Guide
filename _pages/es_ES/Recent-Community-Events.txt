No quería tener que hacer esta publicación, pero es importante que lo haga por la seguridad de la comunidad.

About three weeks ago, on April 2nd, compelling evidence in the form of explicit conversation logs surfaced indicating that a 22-year old member of the 3DS, Wii U, and Switch hacking communities, [Dazzozo](https://dazzozo.com/) ([Github](https://github.com/Dazzozo)), was sexually involved in a long distance relationship with a minor. Él, más específicamente, intentaba dejar el país para tener relaciones sexuales con este menor lo cual es una clara violación de [las leyes de turismo sexual relevantes](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/section/15). When confronted, Dazzozo made no attempt to deny this behavior; instead, he stated that he was unaware that the sex tourism laws applied. He has since been banned from the place where this situation occurred, and all information has been turned over to the relevant authorities.

This is not the first time something like this has happened in the 3DS hacking community. Just recently, Cruel\`, a well-known developer in the community, was convicted on child pornography charges and will be spending [20 years in prison](http://www.gwinnettdailypost.com/local/gwinnett-man-convicted-of-running-child-porn-site/article_05ad133f-165f-5afe-9714-92fc4445ead1.html) as a result.

I want to be abundantly clear: this type of predatory behavior is indefensible; no form of healthy relationship can develop in a situation where there is a power imbalance as large as that between an adult and a 15-year old. This type of "[grooming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_grooming)" behavior is extremely damaging to the minors affected by it. They tend to be isolated from friends and have their personality changed to match the one of the adult (which is exactly what happened in this situation). This community has many young members who may not fully understand the dangers of this, and it is our responsibility to keep them safe.

If you have knowledge of unhealthy relationships involving an adult and a minor such as this one, it is our responsibility as community members to come forward and protect the minor, even if they do not yet understand that their relationship is damaging.
